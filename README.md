GAIA is a free to use service for analyzing phenomenons using big images and/or data sets using R-Script.

  - Once registered, create projects and manage them
  - Input raw R-Script code or upload .r files
  - Share projects and scripts in a collaborative manner
  - This service is and will always be free of charge! :+1:

### Tech

GAIA was developed and works purely on open source software and projects :

* [Bootstrap] - Responsive HTML, CSS and Javascript framework
* [Node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [MongoDB] - Easy to use database
* [jQuery] - duh!
* [Atom] - Hackable texteditor


And of course GAIA itself is open source with a [public repository][Git] on GitHub.
